For quickly recording thoughts, inspirations, and urls while you're out making waves on the world wide web.

A simple extension that just opens a pop up with an iframe to [kinopio.club/add](https://kinopio.club/add)

## Mac/Safari version

The Safari version is built from the `/app-store` version with [safari-web-extension-converter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari)

`/app-store` version is identical to `/firefox`, except the url specifies as qs `?appStoreView=true` that hides all the urls that apple doesn't like

```
cd kinopio-extensions
xcrun safari-web-extension-converter --project-location './safari' ./app-store
```

> Dev Note: Safari extensions cannot persist localStorage when using kinopio.local or localhost urls
